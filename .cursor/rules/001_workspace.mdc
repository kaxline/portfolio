# Portfolio Site Architecture

## Core Technologies
- TypeScript: Primary language for type-safe development
- React: UI component framework
- Vite: Build tool and development server
- Vitest: Testing framework
- TailwindCSS: Utility-first CSS framework
- Tailwind Plus (formerly Tailwind UI): Pre-built component library
- React Router

## Directory Structure
- /src: All source code
  - /components: Reusable React components
  - /pages: Page-level components
  - /helpers: Utility functions
  - /types: TypeScript type definitions
  - /styles: Global styles and Tailwind configuration
  main.tsx
- /tests: Test files for components and utilities
- /public: Static files served as-is

## Key Constraints
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow TypeScript best practices with proper typing
- Maintain responsive design using Tailwind's classes
- Write tests for all components and utilities
