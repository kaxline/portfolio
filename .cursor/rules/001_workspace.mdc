# Portfolio Site Architecture

## Core Technologies
- TypeScript: Primary language for type-safe development
- React: UI component framework
- Remix: Full-stack React framework for server rendering and routing
- Vite: Build tool and development server
- Vitest: Testing framework
- TailwindCSS: Utility-first CSS framework
- Tailwind Plus (formerly Tailwind UI): Pre-built component library

## Directory Structure
- /app: Remix application code
  - /routes: Route components and data loaders
  - /components: Reusable React components
  - /hooks: Custom React hooks
  - /utils: Utility functions
  - /models: Data models and server functions
  - /styles: Global styles and Tailwind configuration
  - /types: TypeScript type definitions
  - /assets: Static assets (images, fonts)
- /tests: Test files for components and utilities
- /public: Static files served as-is

## Key Constraints
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow TypeScript best practices with proper typing
- Implement Remix patterns for routing and data loading
- Maintain responsive design using Tailwind's classes
- Write tests for all components and utilities
- Leverage server-side rendering for performance and SEO
