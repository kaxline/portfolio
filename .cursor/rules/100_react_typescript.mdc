# React & TypeScript Guidelines

## Component Structure
- Use functional components with explicit return types
- Define props interfaces for all components
- Implement FC<PropsType> or explicit return type
- Use named exports for components
- One component per file
- Keep components focused on single responsibility

## TypeScript Usage
- Avoid 'any' types except in test files
- Use proper type imports from libraries
- Define interfaces in separate files for reused types
- Use discriminated unions for complex state
- Leverage generics for reusable components

## State Management
- Use React hooks (useState, useReducer) for local state
- Implement custom hooks for reused logic
- Consider React Context for shared state
- Add proper typing to all state values and handlers

## File Naming
- PascalCase for component files (.tsx)
- camelCase for utility files (.ts)
- types.ts for type definitions
- index.ts for barrel exports
